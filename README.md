# Auto-Major
 This is my first Discord bot, first JavaScript project, and first real form of software.
 This is a passion project so I work on it when I can.
 Auto Major is a bot designed for a server full of band kids (as the name is a pun on Drum Major and Automated Process)
Since I'm learning how to use Discord.JS and JavaScript in general, 90% of the code is borrowed from this site: https://discordjs.guide/
All credit goes to the site when due.
